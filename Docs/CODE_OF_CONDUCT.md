# CS50x Learner Code of Conduct

Hey CS50x learners! Before diving into the coding adventures, let's chat about a few important things to make our journey awesome.

## Academic Honesty

CS50x is all about honesty and integrity. We're here to learn, and that means doing our own work. **Please don't copy code directly from the problem sets or any other source.** If you do, it's not cool and goes against CS50x rules.

### Consequences

If we get caught copying code or being dishonest, there can be serious consequences. Check out the details in the [CS50 Academic Honesty article](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/honesty/). Let's keep it fair and square!

## Respect and Collaboration

We love collaboration! Chat with fellow learners, discuss ideas, and help each other out. But when it comes to assignments, make sure it's your own work. Always give credit where it's due and be respectful.

## Reporting Stuff

If you see someone not playing by the rules or doing something fishy, let's help each other out. Report it to the course staff so we can keep CS50x a great learning environment.

By rocking CS50x, you're agreeing to play by these rules. If not, there could be consequences. Let's keep it real, keep it fun, and most importantly, keep it honest.

Happy coding!
