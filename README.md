## Overview

This repository contains:

- **Week 00:** Scratch projects and early problem sets.
- **Week 01:** C programming lectures and exercises (e.g., Mario, contacts, hello, meow, calculator).
- **Week 02:** Topics on arrays, strings, and additional challenges.

It is designed to serve as both a learning tool and a reference for projects completed during the course.

## Directory Structure

- **Docs/**: Setup guides, custom make scripts, and environment configuration documents.
- **Week00/**: Scratch projects and problem sets.
- **Week01/**: C programming lectures, assignments, and supplementary exercises.
- **Week02/**: Deeper dives into arrays, strings, and related topics.
- **Others:** Additional resources such as testing files and the MIT License.

## Setup and Installation

To prepare your environment on a Mac, follow these steps:

1. **Environment Setup:**  
   Refer to [Docs/README.md](Docs/README.md) for detailed instructions on setting up your development environment and installing the required libraries.

2. **Dependencies:**  
   Install the necessary Python libraries by running:

   ```bash
   pip install -r Docs/requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Custom Make Script:**  
   For using the custom `make` command, review [Docs/make.md](Docs/make.md). This script automatically selects the appropriate Makefile based on your current directory, ensuring smoother workflow for CS50 projects.

4. **CS50 Library:**  
   Follow the instructions provided in [Docs/README.md](Docs/README.md) for setting up and linking the `cs50.h` library in Visual Studio Code or your preferred IDE.

## Usage

- **C Programs:**  
  Navigate to the relevant week (e.g., `Week01`) to compile and run your C programs using the provided Makefile or the custom make command.
  
- **Scratch Projects:**  
  Visit the Scratch links in the README files (such as the one in `Week00/ProblemSet/README.md`) to run and interact with projects created in Scratch.

- **Testing:**  
  Example test files (like `Testing/testing.c`) are provided to practice and verify your code.
