# Problem Set 0
This is my CS50x problem set 0. If you're a CS50 student, please refrain from directly copying this project to complete your assignment. Instead, use it as inspiration for your own work. Direct copying could lead to academic misconduct under HarvardX rules. Here is the live version of the same project on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/939903003/) website.

**Notification by HarvardX**: 
Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you, per the courseâ€™s policy on academic honesty. The staff conducts random audits of submissions to CS50x. Students found to violate this policy will be removed from the course. Students who have already completed CS50x, if found to be in violation, will have their CS50 Certificate permanently revoked.
